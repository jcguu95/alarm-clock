## Get started

    -   Manually download alarm-clock and set-up your load path.

-   To auto-start alarm-clock every time you open Emacs add these lines to your .emacs file:

          (require 'alarm-clock) ; Not needed if you use package.el

## Basic Usage

### `alarm-clock-set`

Set an alarm clock with the time following tips.
TIME can be "6"(6 seconds), "11 minutes", "10 hours", "11:40pm", etc.
MESSAGE will be shown when notifying at setting time.

Use `a` to set a new alarm clock, `C-k` to delete current alarm clock.

-   Add these lines to your .emacs file:

          (alarm-clock--turn-autosave-on)

## Q & A

-   Meet `(wrong-type-argument package-desc nil)` on Mac OSX.

    -   Install `gnu-tar`.

        > brew install gnu-tar

    -   Try to set `quelpa-build-tar-executable` to the path of `gtar`, (e.g "/usr/local/bin/gtar").

    -   Then reinstall this package.

## Appendix

I'd be glad to receive patches,
comments and your considered criticism.

_Have fun with alarm-clock!_

## Notes by Jin

The magic is done by emacs built-in
[timer](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Timers.html).
Inspect the functions `run-at-time` and `cancel-timer` in the source code for
more information. The former schedules another function, `alarm-clock--notify`,
to be run at a given time in the future. While `alarm-clock--notify` is
launched, with the right values, the sound and notification will be launched
right away.
